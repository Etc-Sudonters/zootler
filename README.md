For funsies attempt at an alt-frontend for ootr,
mostly I work on whatever I find interesting at the moment


- Logic: Rules governing how items, etc are placed
  - [x] lex logic
  - [ ] parse logic
  - [ ] do something useful with the logic
- ECS: Storage/query system
  - This feels as complete as it needs to be for now
- World: Placement of items within the world
  - [x] load locations and items
  - [ ] place items according to logic
